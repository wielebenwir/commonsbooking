Commons Booking is a plugin for management and booking of common goods. 

## Description

This plugin gives associations, groups and individuals the ability to share items (e.g. cargo bikes, tools) with users. It is based on the idea of Commons and sharing resources for the benefit of the community. 

CommonsBooking was developed for the ["Commons Cargobike" movement](http://commons-cargobikes.org/), but it can be used for any kind items.

**Unique features:**

* Items can be assigned to different locations for the duration of a timeframe, each with their own contact information. You can display all locations via shortcode as an interactive map.
* Simple booking process:  bookable timeframes can be configured with hourly slots oder daily slots.
* Auto-accept bookings: A registered user can book items without the need for administration. 
* Codes: The plugin automatically generates booking codes, which are used at the station to validate the booking. 
* Managers can set holidays or repair slots to prevent items from beeing booked.


**Use cases:**

* Your association owns special tools that are not in use every day, and you want to make them available to a local group.
* You own a cargo bike that you want to share with the community, and it will be placed at different locations throughout the year.

### 2.6.11 (23.02.2022)
FIXED: Some users reported that bookings were no longer possible. After clicking on "continue to booking check" the expected booking page was not loaded. Since this only occurred on some systems and sporadically, it was not possible to determine the cause in the individual cases.

### 2.6 (03.02.2022)
Notice: Version 2.5 was only a release candidate is skipped as a stable release to to technial reasons

#### New
* Bookings as a separate menu item, better overview in the backend. The bookings are no longer listed under menu item "time frame" They moved to  a new menu item "Bookings". 
* Dashboard: Revision of the dashboard. Now shows today's pickups and returns.
* Reminder emails: Users will receive reminder and feedback emails before and after a booking.* Manage Usage Restrictions: Restrictions can now be managed. These can be notifications of broken or missing parts or the declaration of a total breakdown (e.g. due to a repair). Bookings that are within the affected time frame are automatically cancelled in case of a total breakdown and an info email is sent to users and CB managers. Notices are displayed in the booking calendar and users can be notified about changes.
* A map view can now be set for the location page. The setting can be activated via the location editor.
* Customizable booking confirmation text on booking page ("Your booking has been confirmed"). Can now be customized in Settings -> Templates.
* Maximum advance booking period is now customizable.The period is set to 365 days by default.  This setting also applies to all existing time frames.  The setting is done via the time frames. The time frame can thus be created for a longer or infinite period. Users can then always only book a maximum of x days in advance, calculated from today.
* Thumbnail size in article and location lists now adjustable (Settings -> Templates -> Image formatting).
* GBFS API integrated to enable standardized data exchange with other mobility platforms.
* Calendar Legend:The booking calendar has now received a legend to explain the colors and settings of the calendar.
* For experts: metadata sets (individual attributes / fields can be added to items or categories here).API extended (individual API releases possible).

#### Enhanced or changed
* The map view no longer shows pickup notes and contact details in the small preview popup, as we want to output these only in the booking process. Also, these options have been removed from the map settings.
* In the export function, the custom fields created by CommonsBooking are displayed to be able to add them to the export.
* The booking list has been revised. The design has been adjusted accordingly and the booking status has been integrated.
* Export function extended with more standard fields (name of the borrower etc.).
* In the booking calendar, the time selection in the calendar can now be reset.
* Booking codes are now also displayed in the booking list (My bookings).
* Pickup notes are now displayed differently in the booking calendar and in the booking confirmation. Attention: Template change. If you change the template manually, please check the adjustments and correct them if necessary.
* For cancellations, the cancellation time is saved and displayed in the booking details view at the top of the status message.

#### Fixed bugs
* Locations in time frame editing are now sorted alphabetically.
* On misconfigured servers, there could be an error related to geo-coding that prevented locations from being saved. Switching to a different software library should fix this bug.
* Minor adjustments to guarantee compatibility with Wordpress 5.9 and PHP 8.

### 2.4.5 (10.05.2021)
* NEW: Restrict bookings to user groups. It is now possible to restrict bookable timeframes to one or more user groups to restrict bookings based on these timeframes.

* FIXED: In a some combination of time frames it could happen that an already existing booking could be overwritten (in case of slotwise booking). (#610)
* FIXED: Some parts in the calendar were not translated to English when the website language was set to English. (#545)
* FIXED: API was available by default - this is standard behaviour of the wordpress integrated API too. Now the CommonsBooking API is deactived by default an can be activated in CommonsBooking options. We also removed the Owner information from items that has been available via the API (first and last name)
* FIXED: In the email template tags, the tag following the pattern {{xxx:yyy}} could not be used within an a href link as it is not allowed by Wordpress security methods. We have now added the alternative divider #. This now also works in a href links. Example a href="{{xxxx#yyyy}}"
* FIXED: New booking codes could not be generated in some cases.


### 2.4.4 (26.04.2021) 
* NEW: Added category filter in items and locations shortcode. You can use [cb_items category_slug=category_slug] to show items by a single category.
