# Your first steps with CommonsBooking

__

In this section, you will learn how to [create items](/en/documentation/first-steps/create-item) and [locations](/en/documentation/first-steps/create-location), and how to make them bookable within specific timeframes. Availability is defined by setting up [timeframes](/en/documentation/first-steps/booking-timeframes-manage), which can be further restricted using [restrictions](/en/documentation/first-steps/manage-booking-restrictions). Bookings can be limited through [booking rules](/en/documentation/first-steps/setup-bookingrules), and locations can be closed using [holiday timeframes](/en/documentation/first-steps/timeframes-holidays).

The following pages will guide you step by step through the setup process. Begin by creating an [item](/en/documentation/first-steps/create-item), a [location](/en/documentation/first-steps/create-location), and a [timeframe](/en/documentation/first-steps/booking-timeframes-manage). If necessary, you can then move on to [restrictions](/en/documentation/first-steps/manage-booking-restrictions) and [booking rules](/en/documentation/first-steps/setup-bookingrules).

CommonsBooking is a highly flexible tool, which can feel a bit overwhelming at first. These guides are here to help you get started and to familiarize yourself with the basic concepts of CommonsBooking.

If this is your first time using CommonsBooking, be sure to check out the [Basics](/en/documentation/basics/)(not translated yet) section as well.
