# First steps

__

After you finished the [installation](./documentation/setup/install), this section will guide you, step by step, to
create your first interactive booking.

## Overview

We give a brief overview of the different concepts used in the plugin. If this is your first time using CommonsBooking,
be sure to check out the [Basics](./documentation/basics/)(not translated yet) section as well.

At first, you have to [create items](../first-steps/create-item) and [locations](../first-steps/create-location), and how to make them bookable within specific timeframes.
Availability is defined by setting up [timeframes](../first-steps/booking-timeframes-manage), which can be further restricted using [restrictions](../first-steps/manage-booking-restrictions).
Locations can be closed using [holiday timeframes](../first-steps/timeframes-holidays).
Using [booking rules](../first-steps/setup-bookingrules) you can further limit or control the booking process.

:::info
All of the guides in this section assume that you are logged in to the WordPress backend with administrator rights, and
that the "CommonsBooking" menu item is selected on the left-hand side.
