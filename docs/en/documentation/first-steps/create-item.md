**Item description**

Use the text editor on the page only for the detailed description of your item (equipment, dimensions, features, use-cases).
This description will be displayed on the item detail page.

**Item image**

Please make sure to include an image of the item.
The image has to be added not in the text editor, but on the right side under the "Publish" button.
The image will be displayed in the frontend map, in the location and item list, as well as during the booking process.

**Item Admin(s)**

Select one or more users to allow them to edit and manage this specific item.
Only users with the role cb_manager can be selected here.

**Password protection (since 2.10.8)**

It is possible to protect an item with a password. To do this, click next to "Status" on the right side of the item and add a password. Now, users can only book this item if the correct password was entered.
