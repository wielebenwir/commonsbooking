# GBFS

::: danger API bug
A bug in the API is documented in [Issue 1388](https://github.com/wielebenwir/commonsbooking/issues/1388). The temporal availability may therefore not be correct.
:::

Since 2.5

This interface provides data of [locations](../first-steps/create-location),
[items](../first-steps/create-item) and their availability via
[timeframes](../first-steps/booking-timeframes-manage) in a standardized schema.
The following endpoints of the _General Bikeshare Feed Specification_ ([GBFS](https://www.gbfs.org/documentation/)) schema are supported:

* station_status
* station_information
* system_information
* gbfs.json (Discovery)
