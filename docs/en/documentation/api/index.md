# Interfaces / API

The CommonsBooking plugin provides various interfaces for using the data or interacting with the booking system:

* [CommonsAPI](what-is-the-commonsapi)
* [GBFS](gbfs)

Additionally, you can also use the [standard WordPress REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api) with some technical understanding.
