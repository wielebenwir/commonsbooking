# Booking list

Using the shortcode `[cb_bookings]`, you can display the booking list on any page.

It is recommended to create a page titled "Bookings" and insert the shortcode there.

The booking list will then be automatically generated and always displays the bookings that the currently logged-in user has access to.

  * Users with the role "Subscriber" -> see their own bookings
  * Users with the role "cb_manager / CommonsBooking Manager" -> see all bookings of the locations to which they are assigned as managers
  * Users with the role "Administrator" -> see all bookings
