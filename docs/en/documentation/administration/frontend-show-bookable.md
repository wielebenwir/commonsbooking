# Displaying lending offers in the frontend

To display the list of items, you need to insert a **shortcode** into the WordPress editor. CommonsBooking offers [various shortcodes for maps, tables and lists](./shortcodes).

  * First create a page, for example "**My Bikes**".
  * Now copy the following shortcode into the editor (including the square brackets): `[cb_items]`
  * If you are using the WordPress Block Editor, you must first insert the "Shortcode" block.

## About the item list

The item list shows you all items that are published. If a bookable timeframe is also defined for the item, the bookable period and the location are also displayed.

Published items that are currently not assigned to a location via a timeframe are also displayed in the list with a note that they are currently not bookable.

## Additional options

You can find more options for displaying bookable items, such as location lists, a map or an availability table, in the article [Shortcodes for frontend display](./shortcodes).
