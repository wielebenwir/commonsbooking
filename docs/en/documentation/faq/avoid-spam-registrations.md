# How do I prevent spam registrations

There are several ways to do this (suggestions from the community):

* A honeypot diverts bots without bothering people: https://wordpress.org/plugins/honeypot/

* "I once wrote a tiny plugin for **UltimateMember where you simply have to enter a text to register**. Accessible and it keeps all bots out: [Download from GitHub](https://github.com/hansmorb/um-captchaquiz/raw/refs/heads/master/um-captchaquiz.zip). Just create a text box and enter the meta key in the plugin settings."

* "We use hCaptcha for WordPress. After installation, select the registration you use in the plugin settings (e.g., UltimateMember; by default the built-in WordPress registration should be selected). To use it, you need to create an hCaptcha account. They advertise Privacy-First and that no user data is sold. I have not checked this myself." — [Download from the plugin directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/hcaptcha-for-forms-and-more)
