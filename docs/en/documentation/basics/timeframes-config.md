# Timeframe types

You select the timeframe types in the timeframe editor. Here we describe the types that can be set there.

Higher values override lower ones.

  * 1 = **Bookable**: allows pickup & return and use (bookable in the calendar)
  * 2 = **Holiday:** prevents selecting this period for pickup, return, or use. This type can also be applied over an already defined "bookable" period.
  * 3 = **Repair**: prevents selecting this period for pickup, return, or use. This type can also be applied over an already defined "bookable" period.
