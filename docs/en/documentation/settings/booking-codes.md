#  Booking codes

__

When booking codes are activated, they will be created for each booking and can be used by locations as passwords to identify the person picking up the item. Booking codes can only be generated once for every day and thus only for day-based rentals. They can be created when setting up a [timeframe](/en/documentation/first-steps/booking-timeframes-manage). The codes will also be listed at the end of the timeframe detail page. Additionally, they can be downloaded as a CSV file for further processing.

The available booking codes are located in the **Booking codes** tab under Settings -> CommonsBooking.

You may add booking codes that fit your project and city here. If you can't think of any, you may use the following:
