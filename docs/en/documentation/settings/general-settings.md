#  General Settings


The general settings are located in the **General** tab under Settings -> CommonsBooking.

  * **Slug**
    * Modify the slugs for your booking URLs here. This can be useful if you want the URLs to be displayed in a specific format (e.g., `https://example.com/my-items/item-name`).
  * **Bookings page**
    * Please select the page that should be opened when the user clicks on "My bookings" in the [ User Widget ](../administration/widget). This is usually a page where the cb_bookings shortcode is embedded.
  * **Booking comment**
    * Configure whether users can leave a comment when making a booking. This comment will be attached to the booking.
  * **Global location settings**
    * Change the default behaviour in regards to overbooking specific closing days for all locations. This just defines the default behaviour and can be overridden individually by each location. See [Location settings: Overbooking]( ../first-steps/create-location#overbooking ) for more information.
