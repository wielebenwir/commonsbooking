#  Language & date format


The language as well as the date format used in the plugin is pulled from your WordPress settings.

You can change these settings as follows:

**Change language:**

  * Settings -> General: Site Language 

**Change the date format**

CommonsBooking uses the time and date settings you have set in WordPress under "Settings -> General -> Timezone". The date format and time format set below will also be the format that CommonsBooking uses. This, for instance, affects the date format shown on the booking confirmation page and in emails.

It is therefore important to check that you have configured the correct timezone in WordPress.
