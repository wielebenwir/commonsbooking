# About Us

CommonsBooking is an open-source [WordPress Plugin](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/introduction-to-plugins) which was initiated by the association [wieLebenWir e.V.](https://www.wielebenwir.de) around 2014.
It started with the loaning of cargo bikes within the framework of the so-called Free Cargo Bikes in Cologne, Germany.
This framework has grown into a nationwide association that today lists more than 100 free cargo bike initiatives.
The umbrella organization is called [Verband Freie Lastenräder e.V.](https://freies-lastenrad.org/verband/) (VFL) and meets once a year at the location of an arbitrary initiative.

On the history of the plugin: A previous version was superseded by a redesign. Currently the plugin is available in major version 2. A previous version that was already widespread can be found under [cb-legacy](https://github.com/wielebenwir/CommonsBooking_1).

## Lending Libraries

The plugin is also used in other areas, e.g. in [tool lending libraries](https://leihladen-vernetzung.de).
