##  Application areas

The WordPress plugin was originally developed for the needs of the [„Free cargo bike movement"](http://www.dein-lastenrad.de),
 but it can be used for the rental of any item.

  * You or your organization have tools that are not used on a daily basis and you want to make them available to local groups.
  * You own a cargo bike and want to share it with the community, it should be stationed at different locations throughout the year.
